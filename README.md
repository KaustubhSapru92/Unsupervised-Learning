# Unsupervised-Learning
To make sense of non-labelled data we often cluster it into segments to observe a pattern if there is any. Here a common credit card dataset available is analysed. 
The k-Means algorithm is used to generate clusters to order to segment data and understand it better in order to formulate startegies target consumers more effectively. 
The accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix are demonstrated.
